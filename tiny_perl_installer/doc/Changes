Revision history for TinyPerl
   
2.0  Sat Jan 4 06:11:30 2002
   - The LibZip module now stay inside tinyperl.exe and Perl was build
     with the XS of Compress::Zlib inside. Now we don't need the little
     directory ./lib! ;-P
   - TinyPerl can generate binarys (executables) for your script,
     Type -bin for more!

1.1  Sat Dec 28 20:25:01 2002
   * Just some minor adjustments:
     - Cut off all the POD of files inside lib.zip using Pod::Stripper.
     - UPX files inside lib.zip file.
     - Fix some Config.pm "flexible" variables.
   
1.0  Wed Dec 11 01:52:01 2002

Enjoy! :-P
